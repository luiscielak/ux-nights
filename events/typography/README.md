## About our Speakers

### Rose DiSanto

Rose DiSanto, principal and founder of DiSanto Design, is an accomplished, award-winning graphic designer, teacher, and incurable volunteer. She has worked with Fortune 500 companies like Apple Computer, Sheraton Hotels and Reebok but her true passion lies with helping both local and national nonprofit, educational and arts-based organizations spread their message and their work. Organizations like the American Cancer Society, New England Conservatory of Music, Bridge Boston Charter School, Paul Newman’s The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, and The Steppingstone Foundation to name a few.

She currently sits on the board of AIGA Philadelphia where she founded the city’s first mentoring program for graphic designers.

Currently, Rose is spearheading the committee for Civic + Community Engagement—a new initiative that seeks to engage AIGA’s membership of creative thinkers, problem solvers and designers with the greater community at large. And each summer she spends some time as a camp counselor volunteer with The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp.

Rose holds a degree in Visual Communications from the University of Delaware and a Masters in the Arts in Education from Harvard University.
