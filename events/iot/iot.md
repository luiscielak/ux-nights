## Talks

### Magical Me
by: Jeff Deville

Last year, some friends decided to throw an over-the-top, visually arresting Harry Potter Halloween party. It was to be complete with competitions and House Points. That last detail led me to a mistake that would cost me 3 months of my life. I thought: “Wouldn’t it be cool if you could award points in the same visual and verbal way they did in the movies?”

So I tried it.

A lot of money got spent.

A lot of things went wrong.

When things went wrong, I cursed a lot. Then I spent more money.
This talk will be about my foray into the physics, hardware, software, and AI required to replicate the very specific experience I was after. (And about the stuff that went wrong)

### Data and our Senses
by: Luis Cielak

Humans are built to process complexity. In the world of data representation, visualization rules. But what if we could go beyond sight. What if we could hear, smell, touch, and taste data? Well, we can.

In this talk, Luis will share some of the work that inspires him to keep making things with data. He will also share his process on building tools to interpret and represent data that tell stories and help solve problems.
