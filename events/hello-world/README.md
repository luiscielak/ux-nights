## Details

Are you a UX professional, student, or just interested in design? Are you considering switching careers? Or do you just want to hang out with a bunch of cool people and talk about design?

Come join us! This is the kickoff of UX nights, a meetup group where we will be talking about user experience and how it affects your life and the work you do.

The first half will consist of three lightning talks by Sarah, Amber, and Luis. Then we'll have a breakout session, where we'll review resumes and portfolios. We'll look at examples of what is working and what is not, and how to get your foot in the door to your next gig.

## Lightning Talks

### Get down with git
by: Sarah Gray

In this lightning talk, we'll see git in practice. We'll explore how git can help your personal workflow, improve team collaboration, and see how it's used in professional and open source projects. And, best of all, you'll learn how your use of git/github is used to evaluate you in the job search process. This talk will contain lots of hints and tricks to make git work best for you, so don't miss out.

### We The People: Team Working Agreements
by: Amber Burgess

We the People of the Team, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Safety, insure Transparency, provide for the common defence, promote the general Best Practices, and secure the Blessings of Agile to ourselves and our Iterations, do ordain and establish this Working Agreement for the Scrum Team.

Now that you’ve read the Preamble, let’s get into the value of creating Working Agreements for your team, by your team. We will look at how a Team Agreement fosters collaboration in cross-functional teams and helps embody Agile values in a living document.

### UX Discovery Tools
by: Luis Cielak

What does it take to create a successful project from idea inception to implementation? How do we make sure we are solving the right problem and our resources are allocated properly?

In this talk, I will share the tools and processes that we apply during a UX discovery phase. In these sessions we gather information on what motivates our users, how they interact with systems, and how the information gathered leads the way from successful prototypes to happy customer.
