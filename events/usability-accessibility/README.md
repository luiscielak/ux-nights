## Talks

### Accessibility & Color
by: Dave Cooksey

Itâ€™s estimated that 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women have some form of color blindness. While not considered a serious medical condition or a disability, color blindness can make aspects of everyday life difficult.

One growing area of frustration for people who are colorblind are digital interfaces. Text, hyperlinks, calls to action, and data visualizations can all make any experience difficult for colorblind users.

In this talk, Dave will discuss how color matters to both usability and accessibility. He will also introduce a practical approach to designing with color that keeps users with color vision deficiencies in mind.

### Digital Accessibility Tips
