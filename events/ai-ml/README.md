### Declarative Approaches to Building Dashboards
by: Dmitriy Bespalov

We will examine the use of open-source libraries Panel, Holoviews, Bokeh, and Param that allow to quickly build dashboards that facilitate internal data analytics or development of ML methods. These visualizations make use of declarative widgets and significantly reduce the amount of code needed to implement user interactions. In addition, the same code is used to run visualizations within Jupyter Notebooks environment, and as a stand-alone web application.

### Fun with word vectors
by: Ryan Hinkel and Patrick Smith

This talk will begin with a high level explanation of why “words” can be represented as [-6.8159e-02, 6.6481e-01,... -5.4024e-01, -1.7773e-03], after which we will demonstrate a few experiences that are possible using this vectorized understanding of words.
