## Lighting Talks

### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research: Are You Using the Right Tool for the Job?
by: Keren Toledano

Almost anything can be measured. Your website's usability, the success of an app, the value of your business card, your advertisement's efficacy, or the engagement of your customers. Everything can be researched. Studies suggest that for every one dollar that is invested in user experience, it can bring up to one hundred dollars in return. But there are hundreds of research methods! How do you know which to use? How do you quantify "fuzzy things" like feelings? How do you choose what to measure, when to measure it, and how to analyze the results? When can research do more harm than good? Lots of questions to explore during this overview!

### Object Oriented UX
by: Andrew Croce

Andrew will discuss the principles of Object Orientation and the process of object mapping in UX design research and discovery, and how it can help create convergence and understanding for both users and development teams in complex product domains.

### Design Systems — Lessons Learned
by: Sujan Khadgi

This talk will be a briefly cover the following:
- What is a design system and why should you care about it?
- What tools or platforms are out there to create your own design system?
- Maintenance and governance of a design system
